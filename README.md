# Module 4 Portfolio Project Proposal

## Overview

We will soon introduce the requirements for your __Personal Portfolio Project__.

Much like in Module 2, you will have the freedom to choose the topic for your application.

This time, you'll create a **Full Stack Application** using the PERN stack.


This proposal will serve as a starting point for your ideas and plans.

### You must submit a proposal and receive approval from an instructor prior to working on your project.

## Proposal Requirements:

1. An idea-- can be a title w/ a short description

1. At least **3** user stories for what a user can expect to see/do when using your app

1. A wireframe for your front-end

1. An ERD for your back-end. Only **one** table is required, but you must add the columns that are expected for each entry to your table(what info does an entry have)
_For example: a user may have id, name, email, phone_

Your proposal is to be submitted AFTER the Portfolio Project Requirements and Repo have been shared with you in class on **Monday, 2/6** in a **group message with JD && Carlos** via Slack.
