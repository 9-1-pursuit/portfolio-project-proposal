# Module 4 Portfolio Project Proposal


**Tommorrow** we introduce the requirements for your personal portfolio project.

Much like in Module 2, you will have the freedom to choose the topic of which your application will be about.

This time, you'll create a **Full Stack Applciation** using the PERN stack.


This proposal will serve as a starting point for your ideas and plans.

You will submit your proposal in order to get approval for your idea. You may start working on your project after being approved by an instructor.


Proposal Requirements:

- An idea-- can be a title w/ a short description

- At least **3** user stories for what a user can expect to see/do when using your app

- A wireframe for your front end

- An ERD for your backend. Only **one** table is required, but you must add the columns that are expected for each entry to your table(what info does an entry have)
_For example: a user may have id, name, email, phone_


This is to be submitted AFTER the Portfolio Project Requirements and Repo have been shared with you in class on **Tuesday, 2/7** in a **group message with JD && Carlos** via Slack.
